# Java Development Tutorial

Welcome to the Java development tutorial! This step-by-step guide will teach you everything you need to know to become productive with Java development in Neovim.

> **Note:** This tutorial focuses on Java. For Rust-specific features and workflows, see the [Rust Development Guide]({{< relref "/rust-guide" >}}).

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Set up and navigate a Java project in Neovim
- Write Java code with intelligent auto-completion
- Create classes, packages, and manage project structure
- Navigate large codebases efficiently
- Debug Java applications
- Run and manage JUnit tests
- Use self-hosted AI coding assistants (via Ollama)

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Neovim 0.9+ installed
- JDK 11 or later
- Neovim4j configuration installed (see [Installation Guide]({{< relref "/install" >}}))
