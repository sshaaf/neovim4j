# Neovim Configuration for Java Development

This repository contains a streamlined Neovim (v0.11.3) configuration optimized specifically for **Java development**. It leverages [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin management and includes Java-specific LSP, debugging, testing, AI integration, and modern productivity tools.

> **Inspiration:**
> This configuration was inspired by [Melkeydev's Neovim repo](https://github.com/Melkeydev/neovim) and the YouTube talk ["How I use Neovim in 2024"](https://youtu.be/bVKA4Im2yTc?feature=shared).
> It has been simplified and optimized for Java-only development.
